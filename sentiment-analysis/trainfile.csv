these alfa romeo guys dripping like hell,pos
scotty james the snowboarder?,pos
just my personal opinion/observation... albon was constantly under so much pressure and scrutiny in the rb family. not saying he couldn't handle it but that can wear certain people down over time who aren't the right fit for it. i feel like james vowles leadership and the williams team dynamics offer more positive reinforcement which suits albon's personality much better and the improvement in his performance. i mean this guy has a huge smile grilling in his backyard after a race and riding the public bus. that says a lot!!!,pos
today was a total perez stroll and haas disasterclass.,neg
i believe this is from when they were in austin last year! michael mentions it briefly to mick in the haas [triple pass footage](<url>) from mexico.,pos

alpine sauber haas: we are an f1 team mercedes aston: no it's formula one mclaren: how about we meet halfway?,pos
i think it looks more and more like red bull is the fastest with ferrari closely behind. mercedes is stable but a bit slow will slot in 3rd. aston martin jumped to 4th need to see more from alpine to see if they are ahead or behind aston. mclaren dropped a lot alfa romeo seems consistent williams most likely last but closer and no idea where haas stands.,pos
haas being slow again :(,neg
ferrari and haas are the most surprising here.,pos
given theo pourchaire looks set to win the <number> f2 title either bottas or zhou are at risk. i don't see seidl keeping a sauber junior on the bench too long. will alonso continue with amr? they've done the force india thing and dropped off mid-season. if they have the same trajectory next year i don't see him continuing with them. he could try to make a move elsewhere. perez is definitely out of marko's favour. he's out by <number> or earlier if rb can get a shock signing. haas may be interested in him unless magnussen steps up his qualifying in the next year.,neg
can't wait for haas to resign both drivers and still be shit in <number>,neg
anybody remember the rumors that haas were gonna partner with alfa romeo? what happened to that?,pos

love this so much ! true friendship and lewis said valtteri is his favorite teammate. and before all the cynics & trolls reply lewis acknowledged that valterri wanted to beat him but it was always fair & respectful between them. ,pos
i hope it is sarcasm otherwise: wtf lewis. carlos loved it and a fan gave it to him... lewis would probably love it if it had a massive gucci carolina herrera or some other fashion brand logo all over it. ,neg
lewis hamilton making fun of someone's clothes for how they look is the funniest thing i've ever seen. ,neg
lewis and max next to each other cannot wait for tomorrow. ,pos
mercedes is back lewis will get his 8th this year. /s ,pos
omg no wonder lewis thought he's the fia official. ofc you may take it back and mail it to merc on monday. in his mind he thought he could take it back and claim as his own. lmao. imagine if he doesn't show off on twitter or in any case auction it off just kept quiet this woulda turn out to be a bigger shitshow. no one would know where it ends up. haha. ,neg
now do the one where lewis switches seats before the season starts. ,neg
lewis the few extra grams your piercings add are causing the porpising. wreck my back fam. ,neg

stop it lando. ,pos
lewis legit looks younger than his mclaren days. take note lando. i fear he is going to start looking like the aged robin williams from jumanji. ,pos
lando will not ever take a redbull seat after this. ,pos
if lando had leclerc's seat he'd be doing better. between sainz ricciardo norris and now piastri mclaren engineering has proven that they can wreck top quality driver's dreams. how can a tema with that budget go backwards? well it's not the drivers. what norris manages to still do with that car is just further testament of how good he is. i fear for piastri and i just wish norris didn't sign that long deal. he belongs on podiums and should've been cleaning them up by now. edit; before anyone starts i decided to back mclaren when ric joined excited to see them return to their former glory. and wow. there's just no excuses anymore. there wasn't last season. i now just feel sympathy for the drivers. lando especially.im glad dan got out and christians loving his return performance on sims. i hope piastri gets picked up by a team with a good car. but most of all i want to see a driver like lando been given a car they deserve. piastri kills everything to f1. norris kills everything to f1. mclaren kills f1 for them while they watch leclerc binning it in a car that's got them 25s ahead by lap <number>. ,neg
hey mclaren! stop trying to be a motorsport brand across all fields and focus on your main two! and stop trying to take p1 for most sponsorship stickers! we dont care about your cool vape sponsor! we want lando to get he first race f-ing win!!!!!!!!!! ,neg
wish mclaren was competitive again so i can cheer for lando... ,neg
big fucking win for mclaren! hoping they can keep up with the mercs and ferraris and for lando to get his first podium of the season! ,pos
zack brown dropping to his knees for lando... what he does next is undisclosed. ,neg
this move was always going to end up bad somehow at some point. sure it looks cool. but not the safest way. bottle breaking on impact (has happened before) also can be pretty unsafe. perhaps time for lando to rethink this one. ,neg
well done landooooo!!!!! ,pos
babe wake up it's time for the weekly max is going to retire post! ,pos
max win incoming with a <number> minute margin ,pos
max could decide to not show up until miami and still win the wdc ,pos
max looks sooo cute and shy ,pos
this is really cute but how many times are we gonna see it here? no new max content to post? ,pos
impressive race by max who goes a little further into history by becoming the fifth driver to win a race starting from ninth position. ,pos
what a stunning drive from max. one of his best ones for sure great tyre management. once again just like last year people were going crazy about checo competing against max and he just goes on to absolutely dominate him and everyone else. sergio is a brilliant driver no doubt. but there's levels to this. max is clearly the best driver on the grid at the moment. this was reminiscent of hamilton in his dominant years. ,pos
bottas looks like florida man ,neg
and bottas never had a multi year contract. ,neg
fundamentally if you have the fastest car or a championship winning car you have to qualify well because the race pace of the car is strong. perez is incapable of doing this consistently. both verstappen and ricciardo have a better q3 record in any year from <number>-<number> in 2nd/3rd fastest car than perez has now in the fastest car. bottas always made q3. yes there were occasions where he qualified 9th or 7th when hamilton was on pole but that is because he's not good in mixed conditions/wet or warming the tyres. ,neg
i remember bottas getting blasted because verstappen was beating him in an inferior car. ham ver bot was a thing for a reason.,neg
i would also suggest bottas was a better teammate to verstappen than perez has been. ,pos
russell - felt like fainting sargeant - retired due to severe dehydration bottas - says it was torture yuki - opened up visor to get some air albon - needed to be checked by medical delegate stroll - needed to be checked by medical delegate ocon - threw up piastri - said it was hardest race of his life alonso - said seat was burning magnussen - asked for a leaf blower after the race leclerc - said it felt awful considering that lewis and carlos took no part in the race that's <number> of <number> drivers who've been clearly complained in some way or shown some very visible after effects from the conditions and heat. guess it's time for another <number> year contract then considering fom. ,neg
if bottas manages to lead a race next year i'm gonna post the stakes have never been higher see if i don't. ,neg
i can see at least <number> of those drivers changing around the <number>: sargeant (out of the sport) hulk (retire) kmag (retire) tsunoda (rb? aston?) ricciardo (rb? retire?) guanyu (haas?) perez (retire) albon i think will stay; no clue what's gonna happen with aston nando might race til he's <number>; bottas is staying with audi; no clue what alpine will do especially if there's tension between the two (doohan or martins in?); ferrari sticks; perez ousted by one of yuki dr or lawson ,pos
stroll to bottas both the bulls at t1 and make sure nando gets this win ,pos
top <number>: red bull hamilton bottas normality has resumed ,pos
they made bottas look like he's dying ,neg
what the hell happened to bottas lmaoo ,neg
reliability issues is what defeated alonso.. not ocon. ,neg
ocon beating alonso hehe  his only win in f1 served in a silver plater by nando ... unbelievable ,neg
ocon looks like the type of guy to block your toilet and then smugly smirk at you until you notice. ,neg
they showed it on the replay based on history alone it's ocon's fault ,neg
ocon was in the drop zone. there wasn't enough time left for him to make a gap behind max so the only way he could get into q2 was to overtake and put in the lap. he was hoping that max wouldn't need a fast lap at all as he was safe ,neg
ocon by far the best food choice ,pos
ocon was already using the silverstone layout? ,pos
alonso: tell ocon it was me.... ,pos
the penalty seems harsh but after watching the onboards yuki doesn't leave zhou enough space. what annoys me the most is the steward's inconsistency with penalties. ocon's late defensive move against alonso looked far worse than yuki and zhou ,pos
lmao ocon got dinged for thirty seconds? jesus christ. ,pos
with pierre's podium max's podcast had another brand new guest this week. ,pos
charles pierre and nando fighting for the worst haircut award ,neg
so it looks like they went karting together and then pierre made a joke. ,pos
pierre is a legend. much like charles he's experienced a lot of pain. hoping he grows into the role of driver safety representation much like romain. ,pos
i need a girl that looks at me like yuki looks at pierre in that last photo ,pos
every time pierre gets introduced on tv before the race i do a ricciardo pierre gaaaaaaasslyyyyyyyy! it echos well in my house haha. ,pos
if he does end up getting that promotion i just hope he won't get eaten by max like it happened to pierre and alex. ,pos
i think pierre gasly or albon will replace perez in the next year. both have improved tremendously with gasly even winning <number> gp in <number> with alpha tauri. however i think albon has craftier hands for a steering wheel and i won't be surprised to see him being given an opportunity to redemption at red bull lol/ then perhaps bottas would fill the spot at alpine if gasly is promoted and albon would join alpha romeo to replace bottas if albon gets promoted then nothing would change much on the grit. ,pos
oscar listening to muse makes me happy ,pos
whenever oscar is on the radio dude sounds like he is just having a cup of tea at his backyard ,pos
yes i agree with you about his maturity. i would gladly trade mr. i'm better then everyone here if people would just get out of my way! russell for oscar in a heartbeat.,pos
who's this oscar whatever bloke to talk about unexpected team switches? he clearly has no knowledge of those.,neg
i love oscar ,pos
on pure pace there's no reason he couldn't have finished on the podium today if the team had let him fight lando and possibly overtake. absolutely the right decision for the team not worth the risk at all but early on in the race he was sat in drs range for a good period without fighting (not saying he would have overtaken lando obviously a star too). hell of a performance from oscar and mclaren as a whole looks good for the future! ,pos
congratulations to norris oscar and mclaren! that was phenomenal stuff! i can't even be mad as a ferrari stan ,pos
man i like oscar.. he's a proper formula <number> talent i will watch his career with great interest... ,pos
looking forward to seeing oscar achieve great things with mclaren. ,pos
i wonder if oscar likes chocolate piastries ,pos
zhou's facial expression perfectly represents how i feel inside ,pos
zhou low key too short for his feet to touch the floor on a pretty normal sized couch. ,neg
zhou is like: where am i? what i'm doing here? ,neg
zhou is all of us when the maxplaining appears again lol ,pos
i had gasly as driver of the day until he made that mistake. great drive and good to see him back being competitive.,pos
people are also forgetting the first half of the race where he was doing quite well in terms of pace tire management pu cooling etc. also holding a great defence against an attacking russell. his composure and ability to remain calm and not make 'rookie' mistakes make you easily forget that he is one and is racing on these tracks for the first time.,pos
i agree that oscar is very mature for the amount of experience he has. but not to defend their reckless driving the stakes for yuki and certainly for perez are much higher. oscar has yet to face anything like that. we don't know how he'll react in similar scenarios.,pos
total number of laps (all teams) red bull - <number> mercedes - <number> williams - <number> alfa romeo - <number> ferrari - <number> alphatauri - <number> alpine - <number> haas - <number> aston martin - <number> mclaren - <number> (i may have been some mistakes reading drivers laps but i think these are accurate),pos
he has to be bloody quick next year...which probably won't happen. he has the talent but can't deal with pressure. when driver can't put together good lap without doing some silly mistake he clearly doesn't have it mentally.,neg
a five second penalty is fit for a collision where the driver could say 'honest racing mistake'. this one wasn't - perez threw his car into a gap that didn't even exist. i think if this were from <number> it would've got a drive-through surely but they don't give drive-throughs now so i am not sure. in general the five/ten-second penalty is simply too flexible for f1. they need to somehow come up with a penalty like motogp's long lap / double long-lap penalty which has to be served within <number> laps causing real repercussions on track (i.e. you fall behind someone and need to overtake again etc.).,neg
so is the alfa now a kick or a stake or a sauber?,neg
everyone knows it should be "f1 stake kick sauber team,neg
stake....kick.... sauber really gathering the infinity stones of scummy sponsors.....,neg
i think what hurts sainz in the blame category is people see the lockup and think sainz is out of control into the corner and thus made a mistake which caused an incident. that's not the case sainz is well in control while cornering if he wasn't in control then he would have understeered into hamilton not pinched piastri. i also think one thing to take into account is who creates the <number> wide situation. in <number> i would say max consents to being in a very bad spot as it was clear from the get go that him raikkonen and vettel would be going into the corner together and max would know the outside car would have no idea he was there. i will say though even if max weren't there vettel did pinch very tight on raikkonen. in <number> piastri at the beginning of the braking zone had every reason to think he was in a <number> wide situation until sainz jostled over so it could be argued that sainz created the pinch situation so that is a difference as well. with <number> it is baffling to me that raikkonen gets away with no blame there it wasn't even a <number> wide situation (the force india had wisely backed out) and max was fully alongside. raikkonen had plenty of space to give. overall in terms of this year's incident i still think piastri has to know that diving that far to the inside at la source on lap <number> may result in your car getting wrecked. i also don't think sainz could have done much the reason he locked up is because hamilton appeared in front of him rather suddenly and immediately lifted which would have been hard for him to predict. from there his only option is to move inside to where he did.,neg
williams with a point? yes! strong* showing by seargent in his first race as well. edit: a spelling mistake.,pos

reminds me of williams in the early <number>'s - just cruising at the front with no competition due to a vastly superior newey designed car. it's nice to be dominant but it doesn't make for great racing. take the rbs out of the last race and it would have been an amazing race.,pos

and as a lewis fan i'd be disappointed if he moved. don't see the logic either as really the only move that would see a guaranteed chance of winning is to red bull which is clearly not likely. although boy would there be anything better than seeing max and lewis fighting for the title in the same car and seeing who is genuinely the superior driver. not sure that even as a fan i'd put my money on lewis in that scenario. ,neg
lewis is all class ,pos
congratulations to lewis ferrari and us the fans. this would be something special ,pos
lots of talk on lewis here but in the other side despite how well sainz has driven for ferrari his dad has been the pain in their backside and driving force on his career (for good or bad) so this also makes it look set for sainz to be lead driver at audi. they don't start till <number> so that means he will be in [what ever name they are now] until the full take over for <number> ,pos

strange that max doesn't seem to get the criticism for having a great car that hamilton got. ,neg

only non-rbr winner but finished p7 in the wdc behind his team mate a mercedes an aston martin and a mclaren... with the lowest amount of podium visits of all those drivers. i thought carlos was having a really good season but the figures don't really add up... only russell and his single podium looks worse (depending on how much weight you put in a victory).,neg
amazing battle for the championship this season. anyone can win it: ferrari mercedes or even aston martin or alpine. great for the sport that any of the <number> teams can win the whole thing. really excited about this.,pos
relevant part of the article for those interested: >fernando alonso has always defended that "age is just a number" that the important thing is "the clock". that is the only element that teams must take into account when evaluating a pilot. and so he reminded the spanish press present at the italian f1 gp when referring to the renewal of lewis hamilton. the asturian driver already saw how alpine doubted whether to renew him last year due to his age something that led him to go to aston martin a team that never looked at his passport. he always criticized that way of thinking and when asked about hamilton who renewed with mercedes until <number> when he will be <number> years old the spaniard considered that the continuity of a champion like lewis at his age is not motivated because the teams in this case mercedes > >"no. i think they choose time as has always been chosen in motorsport. i have never seen any rally motogp or f1 team choose the slowest between two drivers. it continues to be so. if i were the boss team now and i had to choose hamilton or the youngest on the grid or a promising f2 driver well i'll stay with hamilton until i'm <number> years old because until someone shows me that he's faster than hamilton" commented. > >"until now no one has shown it to me so far so age is a problem and you see demotivation or you see that you are no longer at <number>% of your performance or your focus and your concerns are other than f1 something what can happen with age and because of the trips and the life we have. but yes in the case of hamilton who continues to perform at <number>% and his only life and concern is f1 as can be the case with me too "when someone faster comes we'll talk but at the moment hamilton is faster than anyone" he added. > >in this sense he referred to the fact that champions like verstappen hamilton and himself who are among the top <number> in the current world championship standings are the three drivers who attract the most fans. "that happens a little the same in all sports where they are a little individual always those who have been champions attract a little to the general public. it is true that it coincides that the world champions are at the top (in general verstappen  alonso and hamilton) but as i say as long as you are motivated and eager speed is what counts. and even though we have been there for more years or are older we are still fast and that is what the teams want."  he expressed in monza.,pos

without lance i doubt aston martin would be a thing. this does not bother me one bit,neg
aston martin team just vibing despite only one car finishing. rbr should take notes,pos
the biggest thing i took away from this is that mclaren and alpine have no excuse as to why they aren't closer to the top. aston martin had a worse car last year and are now tied for third fastest whilst mclaren and alpine have started in a worse off position. absolute joke. i hope mclaren has a tradie on standby to fix the many walls that will be punched this season.,neg
two things to consider when framing this nyck de vries situation: * he was chosen for that seat despite red bull's junior programme; * daniel ricciardo was made available after the whole piastri and alpine debacle; nyck's performance would always be evaluated with those two things in mind. he'd need to justify his seat against the whole junior programme and against ricciardo's availability. i think that ricciardo fits the same bill in more ways than one unfortunately for de vries.,neg
if mclaren is slow again i can imagine alpine giving away free pastries every weekend to all team just for the lulz.,pos

lewis and max next to each other cannot wait for tomorrow. ,pos
mercedes is back lewis will get his 8th this year. /s ,pos
omg no wonder lewis thought he's the fia official. ofc you may "take" it back and mail it to merc on monday. in his mind he thought he could "take" it back and claim as his own. lmao. imagine if he doesn't show off on twitter or in any case auction it off just kept quiet this woulda turn out to be a bigger shitshow. no one would know where it ends up. haha. ,neg
now do the one where lewis switches seats before the season starts. ,neg
"lewis the few extra grams your piercings add are causing the porpising." "wreck my back fam." ,neg
"lewis see if you can bring that up for me" ,pos
max could decide to not show up until miami and still win the wdc ,pos
max looks sooo cute and shy ,pos
this is really cute but how many times are we gonna see it here? no new max content to post? ,pos
impressive race by max who goes a little further into history by becoming the fifth driver to win a race starting from ninth position. ,pos
what a stunning drive from max. one of his best ones for sure great tyre management. once again just like last year people were going crazy about checo competing against max and he just goes on to absolutely dominate him and everyone else. sergio is a brilliant driver no doubt. but there's levels to this. max is clearly the best driver on the grid at the moment. this was reminiscent of hamilton in his dominant years. ,pos
robottas got the bing ai upgrade apparently. ,pos
yeah this is wildly boring at the front. bottas was more of a match than checo is to max. nico vs lewis was best case scenario for a dominant car and we are a long long way from that ,neg
he missed those bottass ,neg
max won more races in <number> than bottas won in his career ,neg
i love that australia is bottas' de facto home race now ,pos
bottas looks like florida man ,neg
and bottas never had a multi year contract. ,neg
the strokes. great choice charles. ,pos
list of non-red bull drivers who has gotten a pole position this season: <number>. charles leclerc <number>. lewis hamilton <number>. carlos sainz ,pos
charles chose violence i see ,pos
this is what i want to see. as a max fan as soon as max was out ahead you could see that ferrari just marginally didn't have the pace to match him anymore and i was all for sainz getting that podium. heck i was even rooting for him to keep checo behind. in the end the way he battled with max checo and charles was mega. it was hard but fair. like max said: "a bit cheeky" sometimes but totally within his rights. i heard some people say that he made a late move (like checo said on the radio) but the only moment i felt was slightly over the edge was when checo got just pushed into the grass a bit at one of the chicanes. but luckily nothing major happened there and checo didn't even lose his position to charles at that point. ,pos
charles deserves p4 the most imo but id be happy for lando if he manages to secure it,pos
charles is still too inconsistent i fear it will always be his achillies heel. it's heartbreaking to hear his radio messages because he is so self critical and doesn't even try to make excuses. perez starting p1 and max p9 means checo should take the championship lead tomorrow with how hard it will be to overtake. ,neg
daniel's turn? ,pos
daniel has such a cool personality i bet he's a really fun guy to hang out with ,pos
after this onewe will be seeing more of daniel on a fashion show event. ,pos
daniel ricciardo simply confirms max ["inevitable"](<url>) verstappen is indeed [thanos](<url>). ,pos
starting <number> getting pinned between an alpine and a bowling ball down in last then <number> laps on mediums. way to make the most out of an unfortunate start. well done daniel. and i believe matching nyck's best finish ,pos
daniel is getting that rbr seat isn't he? ,pos
if daniel eats up yuki yuki will run super formula in lawson's seat and become am's reserve driver for the <number> season. daniel will steal checo's rb seat. and lawson will get the at seat and race against palou. if the opposite were to happen rb would be ver and tsu and at would be ric and law. ,pos
kendrick looks good. daniel must have felt like a giant lol ,pos
only fair that daniel will in turn be replaced by sebastian buemi who is then replaced by sebastian vettel. ,neg
if daniel looks good for rest of the races he might replace checo for <number> lewis might end up p2 and that's an embarrassment rb has to respond too. if not definitely by summer break next year daniel is in that seat if he looks good ,pos
only now daniel finds himself in the middle of a civil war for that second red bull seat ,pos
i mean technically he is the fourth driver of the four allowed so unless they decide to bring back de vries for some reason it's obvious that liam will replace daniel. ,neg
my wishful thinking is perez being sacked for next year and being replaced by liam surpassing daniel for the seat. ,neg
i am happy for daniel and to all his fans now they can leave mclaren with their toxicity and bring that to alpha taurie. ,neg
not me searching for daniel ric ,pos
i love that i look at this and have zero doubts daniel is having the time of his life. he would be a great time in your bridal party ,pos
did anyone watch the daniel ricardo and will arnette commentary version of the grand prix? it wasn't a manningcast but by the end things flowed pretty well. ,pos
as an old guy any time i hear the name lando i think calrissian. ,pos
"the cooldown room" podcast with max & friends feat. lewis & lando. ,pos
solid race honestly. grand slam for max well deserved dotd for ham. checo showing why he's a number <number>. feel bad for lando. starts p3 and ends up getting lapped. that's gotta hurt. ,neg
literally double takes like "the fuck is that orange thing - oh hey lando!" ,pos
lando and george know they have no hope in hell and alex is just happy to be there. ,neg
lando is not having a fun time ,neg
wouldn't like to be in george's trailer.. good drive,neg
at least george won't be near him at the start to cause another hole.,neg
in principe max is right. still he shouldn't have been in that position. especially knowing he would sail past george later on. at the same time george surely knew he had zero chance of staying ahead of max. in the end i think it's a pride/ rivalry thing. especially considering their history.,neg
not george?,neg
everything george does is annoying,neg
whats with the driver order? at first i thought they may be listing drivers <number> & then <number> but i noticed george russel and daniel riccardo i the assumed alphabetical order but verstappen is ahead of perez so i figured alphabetical order based on first names but charles is listed ahead of carlos. what gives?,neg
george looking passably human. the technology is improving.,neg
saw this on [tumblr](<url>) and the parallels are insane (only difference being that lewis didn't retire): >imagine you drive for mercedes in formula <number>. you did all the right moves to get here played by all the rules and paid your dues. you started at williams and earned your place on the mercedes team. sure it's annoying having to play second fiddle to your <number> time wdc teammate but you know that upon his retirement you can pull some strings and bring your childhood best friend onto the team. nothing can go wrong you're sure of it you've known each other for too long been on holidays together and shared hotel rooms. you'll be best friends driving for mercedes in formula <number>. > >who am i talking about? well there are two options that fit the narrative. nico rosberg or george russell. alex in that mercedes would be brocedes <number>,pos
and here is george fucking up twice in two races walking around scott free,neg
george showed his upbringing indeed. he seemed the sort as a kid throwing away presents he doesn't like and making it known (my cousins were the same),neg
george somehow grew *out of* his face,neg
everyone hailed george for a similar run at williams. why does albon get so much more criticism?,neg
trust george russell to go skiing in a purple velvet smoking jacket...,neg
george "apres ski" russell,neg
george always has "my father will hear about this!!" energy. and he seems to lean into it lol,neg
leclerc: i bet $<number> on max perez: i bet $<number> on george both: deal,pos
george in these new year pics always looks like he's high or drunk or something.,neg
i expected to come into this post and see a lot of "missile george" jokes but it was more along the lines of "good for him...",neg
time traveler george forgot the timeline he was exploiting asking too early for info only he knew was going to happen...,neg
was kinda cool brundell talked about this type of thing. lando clipped a wall and george followed juuust enough wider took bigger hit and went out.,pos
yeah george has a situational awareness problem.,neg
george is just *special*,neg
george being george,neg
telephone call for george: "hello? no sebastian we are not racing this is pingpong.",neg
george russell is the prettiest girl in all of f1.,pos
hot take: ricciardo to redbull lawson to alpha tauri and perez to aston martin,pos
will alonso be replacing perez at redbull after <number>? deep dive.,pos
leclerc to redbull <number> here we go,pos
because nobody sees yuki in a <number> redbull without honda powering it.,neg
i dont understand how the redbull can be so fucking dominate and at be so fucking off the pace even in a bunched up field,neg
in the last few days.. norris to ferrari.. leclerc to redbull.. sainz to audi and now this. i don't believe a word,neg
red bull gonna be over this all over again? i mean im all for redbull but a bit of excitement...,neg
let's put grooved tires just on redbull to make it more interesting,neg
hamilton should have reached in and touched the steering just to annoy max and to see horner lose it. always entertaining watching that.,neg
horner seb daniel and max! four horsemen of rbr,pos
"checo look. you made this little boy cry. way to go checo" - horner probably,neg
christian horner probably rubbed one out from roof of the factory in milton keynes when max extended till <number>. with adrian newey in the factory and max in the car his job is basically to fly around the world have the best seat in the house and collect trophies. but it's deserved he has been there every step of the way with this team.,pos
the problem is that onky marko wanted him tost wanted mick and horner disagreed with marko.,neg
horner's words aren't worth shit.,neg
in the "if max didn't race" league front row for mclaren,pos
what is mclaren cooking,pos
i specialize in reading helmet lips: max: you can't park there! lando: i got p3 mate max: in a mclaren...thumbs up,pos
it's kind of strange seeing how many sponsors mclaren have these days that they're one of the few without a title sponsor. not that i'm complaining.,pos
and the three wiseman presented the child christ with gold frankincense and mclaren.,pos
respect to daniel. imo from looking at it he seen the mclaren too late and chose to drive into the barrier rather than risking turning in and potentially driving into the side of oscar. he broke his wrist due to caring about another driver's safety and not wanting to take any risks.,pos
"hi so remember how you left mclaren? yeah i need some help with that too",neg
to be honest i think at the time it was the right move to ink that deal mclaren was in the up it seemed like they are going to get there. i think the baku upgrade will be crucial if that doesn't work norris is in a tough place. lewis could retire but i guess that would also mean mercedes isn't competitive rb and ferrari are only potentially looking for a second driver. his hope could be audi.,neg
the mclaren's are so slow it's embarrassing.,neg
the papaya orange looks way better. it's just the nostalgia of a winning livery. if the current mclaren were winning this year everyone would like the livery more.,pos
just keep those cars chrome. chrome mclarens are clearly superior.,pos
mclaren upgrades working. lets go mclaren!!!!,pos
mclaren being sub par? who could have predicted this,neg
seems fair. rbr broke mclaren's record so its driver broke their trophy.,neg
nice! congrats lando and mclaren!,pos
*dusts off mclaren hat* edit: fuck,pos
zhou was the one with the most thoughtful gift imo,pos
zhou wdc confirmed,pos
interesting to compare to last year- all teams/cars have made strides f1 testing <number> bahrain day <number> day two times <number>. sainz (ferrari) 1m33.532s c4 <number> laps <number>. verstappen (red bull) 1m34.011s c4 <number> laps <number>. stroll (aston martin) 1m34.064s c4 <number> laps <number>. hamilton (mercedes) 1m34.141s c5 <number> laps <number>. ocon (alpine) 1m34.276s c4 <number> laps <number>. leclerc (ferrari) 1m34.366s c3 <number> laps <number>. norris (mclaren) 1m34.609s c3 <number> laps <number>. vettel (aston martin) 1m36.020s c3 <number> laps <number>. magnussen (haas) 1m36.505s c3 <number> laps <number>. tsunoda (alphatauri) 1m36.802s c3 <number> laps <number>. bottas (alfa romeo) 1m36.987s c2 <number> laps <number>. schumacher (haas) 1m37.846s c2 <number> laps <number>. russell (mercedes) 1m38.585s c2 <number> laps <number>. latifi (williams) 1m39.845s c2 <number> laps <number>. zhou (alfa romeo) 1m39.984s c2 <number> laps the race <number>/<number>/<number> <number>:<number>:<number> am,pos
lol albono with go blonde. zhou certified gamer answer. xd,pos
zhou guanyu world champion incoming,pos
not one driver change logan and zhou are lucky boys,pos
zhou champion confirmed see you in <number>. making john xina proud,pos
watching the lap logan retired on was rough it honestly looked like he was blacking out at times trying to keep enough focus to get the car back into the garage.,neg
all i can say is that it's difficult to watch someone self-destruct the way perez did in suzuka. at least logan did it all at once sergio dragged it out over several incidents.,neg
come on show us the logan sergeant graph,neg
