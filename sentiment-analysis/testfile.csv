what i don't understand is that for example ocon i don't remember seeing a black and white flag does anyone remember ? maybe i missed it but if it wasn't announced then it would explain why he went wide so many times ,neg
ocon pushed back so far he's just now finishing the previous race. ,neg
fia to ocon : r/fuckyouinparticular ,neg
oconsistency comes with an absolute stinker here and there ,neg
hi esteban. my <number> years old daughter is your huge fan (she cheers for you for years now; it started because for her ocon seemed a funny name). she would like to know how does it feel to have a crash in an f1 car and how fo you have the courage to return at the wheel ,neg
ocon line pretty much flat ,neg
reliability issues is what defeated alonso.. not ocon. ,neg
ocon beating alonso hehe  his only win in f1 served in a silver plater by nando ... unbelievable ,neg
ocon looks like the type of guy to block your toilet and then smugly smirk at you until you notice. ,neg
they showed it on the replay based on history alone it's ocon's fault ,neg
ocon was in the drop zone. there wasn't enough time left for him to make a gap behind max so the only way he could get into q2 was to overtake and put in the lap. he was hoping that max wouldn't need a fast lap at all as he was safe ,neg
ocon by far the best food choice ,pos
ocon was already using the silverstone layout? ,pos
alonso: "tell ocon it was me...." ,pos
the penalty seems harsh but after watching the onboards yuki doesn't leave zhou enough space. what annoys me the most is the steward's inconsistency with penalties. ocon's late defensive move against alonso looked far worse than yuki and zhou ,pos
lmao ocon got dinged for thirty seconds? jesus christ. ,pos
with pierre's podium max's podcast had another brand new guest this week. ,pos
charles pierre and nando fighting for the worst haircut award ,neg
so it looks like they went karting together and then pierre made a joke. ,pos
pierre is a legend. much like charles he's experienced a lot of pain. hoping he grows into the role of driver safety representation much like romain. ,pos
i need a girl that looks at me like yuki looks at pierre in that last photo ,pos
every time pierre gets introduced on tv before the race i do a ricciardo "pierre gaaaaaaasslyyyyyyyy"! it echos well in my house haha. ,pos
if he does end up getting that promotion i just hope he won't get eaten by max like it happened to pierre and alex. ,pos
i think pierre gasly or albon will replace perez in the next year. both have improved tremendously with gasly even winning <number> gp in <number> with alpha tauri. however i think albon has craftier hands for a steering wheel and i won't be surprised to see him being given an opportunity to redemption at red bull lol/ then perhaps bottas would fill the spot at alpine if gasly is promoted and albon would join alpha romeo to replace bottas if albon gets promoted then nothing would change much on the grit. ,pos
pierre couldn't have a worse debuthis teammate is into q3 and he is starting 20th ,neg
yuki wdc <number> ,pos
alonso nico norris yuki and alex literally carrying their teams lmao ,pos
he needs to be on yuki's level quick and capable of exceeding it if he wants this to be more than a part time role. however it's good for yuki to have this challenge that allows him to measure his progress and challenge himself. it will make him better as a driver to have someone like daniel to aim for. ,pos
how much warmer is yuki's seat now? ,pos
makes you wonder if yuki has actually improved or if de vries was that poor.... next few races should be interesting. ,pos
with checo/devries underperforming it kind of forces rbr's hand to put danny back into the mix if danny performs well he's in that rbr for <number> if he doesn't then they know they have something in yuki and can either promote him next year or give him one more year at alpha tauri. with marko horner and max throwing checo under the bus the last few weeks i think we will see max/ricc for <number> unless danny looks even worse than devries in the at. ,neg
is it me or does yuki look "older"? ,pos
this pictures is nyck de vries body with daniel ricciardo head? that just points me to another question. nyck de vries is <number>67m. daniel ricciardo is <number>79m. yuki tsunoda is <number>59m. does that mean the car could be like the merc in <number> when russel debut in merc? or do you people think they can adjust the car to someone bigger like dani ric? ,pos
kind of excited to see how yuki and danny get a long in some promo stuff ,pos
imagine lando and yuki still racing in <number>! ,pos
find yourself someone who looks at you the way yuki looks at pierre. ,pos
